Dear Mom and Dad,

As I sit down to write this letter, I find myself missing you both more than words can describe. The silence in our empty house reminds me of the warmth your laughter used to fill.

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on the countless small moments we shared. Do you remember the Sunday afternoons when we’d visit the park, your hands always ready to catch me if I stumbled while riding my bike? Or the way you’d surprise me with my favorite dessert after a tough exam? These memories are my anchors in this new city.

Life here is busy but fulfilling. I’ve joined the school’s environmental club, and last weekend we planted trees in the community garden. I wish you could see how much joy it brings me, just like the time you taught me how to grow our own herbs in the backyard. I’ve also started taking cooking classes—something I’ve always wanted to do. Your laughter when I burnt the first batch of cookies still echoes in my mind.

But there’s a void that no amount of independence can fill. I miss our late-night chats about everything and nothing. I worry if you’re eating properly since Dad always forgets to take his medicine, and I can’t help but feel guilty for not being there to remind him.

Please know that I’m doing my best to stay safe and healthy. I’ve made new friends who remind me a little of you—kind, supportive, and always rooting for me. But no one can replace the way you’ve shaped me into who I am today.

Before I sign off, I want to thank you for the countless sacrifices you’ve made. From the sacrifices you made when I was born to the countless sleepless nights you’ve endured while I’ve been away, your love has been my guiding light. I promise to call more often and visit as soon as I can.

Wish you both all the happiness in the world. Until then, know that you’re always in my heart.

With all my love,
[Li Hua]
